# Calculator
A simple calculator built with React and Redux (Overkill right?).

## Introduction
This app was built just for fun and not intended to go into production. `good first issue`s will be raised for first-timers looking to practice how to contribute to open-source and also how to use GitHub.

## Getting started
- [Clone the repo](https://github.com/chuxmykel/calculator.git) and `cd` into the project directory.

- Install all dependencies using `npm i`.

- Start the server using `npm start` and the application will open up on your default browser automatically.

## Contributing
Obviously, this calculator is very basic. It's so basic that you can't delete a character once entered. This and many more issues will be created and please feel free to pick an issue and raise a PR.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
